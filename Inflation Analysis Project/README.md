# Project Title
Inflation Analysis Project  


## Project Overview
This project transforms the inflation data in databricks which involves bronze, silver and gold layers. Data is further cleaned and prepared for analysis and visualization using **Python (PySpark), SQL, Databricks, Delta lake**.


## Tools & Technologies
- Python (PySpark)
- SQL 
- Databricks
- Delta Lake
